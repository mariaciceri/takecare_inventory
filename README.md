# TakeCare Inventory Management

[TakeCare Inventory Management](https://takecare-inventory.onrender.com) is a web application designed for healthcare professionals to efficiently manage stock levels and request products. Users can easily filter items to find what they need and view their selected products in a cart on the same page, making order management more intuitive. For managers, the admin panel provides important alerts when items are low in stock, close to expiration, or when new users need approval, ensuring smooth inventory oversight.

- User Access
    - Users must log in to access the platform.
    - New users require approval; upon registration, a request is sent to the admin panel for manager approval.
- Ordering Process
    - Approved users can search for items, filter them by category, add them to an order list, and submit requests.
    - Orders require approval; while pending, users can modify them.
- Manager Role
    - Managers can approve or reject orders but cannot modify them.
    - They are responsible for updating item categories, stock quantities, expiration dates, and marking critical products.


## User Stories
+ As a first-time visitor, the user:

## UX Design
The application is designed for healthcare professionals, including nurses, doctors, and administrative/warehouse staff responsible for managing medical supplies. It is particularly useful for clinics, hospitals, and care facilities that need an efficient way to track stock levels, place orders, and ensure essential items are always available. Managers benefit from automated alerts for low stock and expiring products, reducing the risk of shortages. While the system is optimized for desktop use in clinical settings, its responsive design ensures that users can access it seamlessly from mobile devices when needed.

### Color and Design Choices
+ The color scheme of TakeCare Inventory Management is primarily composed of shades of blue and gray, carefully chosen to align with the healthcare industry’s aesthetic. Blue is often associated with trust, professionalism, and calmness. Gray complements this by adding a sense of neutrality and balance, ensuring the interface remains clean and easy to navigate without unnecessary distractions. Together, these colors create a professional and reassuring atmosphere for users managing critical inventory tasks.
+ The images used throughout the platform follow the same blue and gray tones to maintain visual consistency and reinforce the theme of reliability. However, the hero image on the general home page features touches of yellow and red to introduce a sense of energy and urgency. This contrast helps capture attention and conveys the importance of efficient inventory management, encouraging users to engage with the system proactively.
+ The favicon was selected to represent the target audience of the application. However, its dark design may not be ideal for users browsing in dark mode.

### Wireframe
+ The initial wireframes for this project were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/):
+ Changes were made throughout the project delevolpment to improve UX and make the navigation more intuitive.

    - They will see a message confirming that they registered but are waiting for approval from management.

    ![Home page for authenticated but not approved user](/docs/images/not-authorized-view.png)

### Admin panel
- When an admin logs in, an alert message is displayed if there are expired or near-expiry items, low-stock items, or pending user approvals.

![Admin home page alerts](/docs/images/warnings-admin-home.png)

- When approving multiple orders at once, if stock is insufficient for all, older orders will be approved first, while newer ones will stay pending. An alert message will indicate which orders couldn't be fulfilled due to low stock.
- If the order was already processed, the status can not be modified again.

![Admin order already processed alert](/docs/images/warnings-admin-order-processed.png)
![Admin approved order alert](/docs/images/warnings-admin-order-approved.png)

- Manager can not add items without expiration date and the expiration date must be in the future.
- When an order is approved, the items are subtracted from the stock.

### User page
- Approved users can filter items by category.
- Users cannot add a quantity greater than the available stock; a message will display the available amount.
- Users can edit item quantities in their session, up to the maximum available:
    - If the entered quantity exceeds stock, it is automatically adjusted to the maximum.
    - If the quantity is less than 1, the item is removed from the list.

![Quantity check gif](docs/images/available-in-stock-message.gif)
![Quantity check screenshot](docs/images/quantity-validation.png)

- If the same item is added again via the form, the quantity updates. If the total exceeds available stock, the item is not added.
- When the order is submitted, the home page is cleaned and the user can start a new request. If they leave an unsent order, the items in the order won't be lost if the page is closed/reloaded.
- Feedback is present for all actions:
    - Adding an item to the order:
    ![Item added successfully message](docs/images/item-added.png)
    - Deleting an item from the order:
    ![Item deleted successfully message](docs/images/item-removed.png)
    - Editing order:
    ![Order being edited message](docs/images/editing-warning.png)
    - Order sent to management:
    ![Order sent successfully message](docs/images/order-saved.png)

- The user can not submit an empty order.

![Empty order warning](docs/images/no-items-to-order.png)

- In the orders page, the users can see their past orders, items ordered, and statuses and modify the order if it is still pending.

![Past orders page](docs/images/orders-display.png)
![Past orders expanded](docs/images/orders-buttons.png)


- Tooltips are available for the statuses:

![Tooltip for pending order](docs/images/pending-order.png)
![Tooltip for approved order](docs/images/approved-order.png)
![Tooltip for rejected order](docs/images/rejected-order.png)

- If deleting a pending order, a popup requesting confirmation is shown, if user clicks "yes", the order is deleted from the database, otherwise, the popup closes.

## Deployment
### First steps
+ To deploy both locally and to an external app, you must first: 
    + Clone the repository from GitHub page by running the command `git clone https://github.com/mariaciceri/takecare_inventory.git`;
    + Alternatively, download it as a ZIP file from `https://github.com/mariaciceri/takecare_inventory` and extract it to a chosen location in your computer;
    + To install the necessary libraries, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    + Run the command `python manage.py migrate` to create the tables in the database before using the program.
    + Create a `env.py` file and at the top `import os`.
    + In the env.py create three variables using `os.environ.setdefault()`:
        + `SECRET_KEY` - and give it a value equivalent to a strong password.
        + `DEVELOPMENT` - and give the value of `"True"`.
        + `DATABASE_URL` - and provide a link to a database of choice.
    + Save the project on your own GitHub account by using the command `git push`.
    + To be able to use the admin panel, run `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the instructions, then use the credentials to access the admin panel and add items and categories to the databases.

    + Make sure to follow these steps before continuing with one of the deployment methods below.

### Deployment to Heroku

+ Create a new Heroku app by clicking on "New" and then "Create new app" on their page;
![Heroku menu with new app creating menu](/docs/images/heroku-new-app.png)
+ In the Deploy tab, look for "Deployment method" and select GitHub;
